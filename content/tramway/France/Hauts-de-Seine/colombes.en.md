Colombes (French pronunciation: ​[kɔ.lɔ̃b]) is a commune in the northwestern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located 10.6 km (6.6 mi) from the centre of Paris. In 2012, Colombes was the 53rd largest city in France.

## Name
The name Colombes comes from Latin columna (Old French colombe), meaning "column". This is interpreted as referring either to a megalithic column used in ancient times by a druidic cult which stood in Colombes until its destruction during the French Revolution, or to the columns of an atrium in a ruined Gallo-Roman villa that also stood in Colombes.

## History
On 13 March 1896, 17% of the territory of Colombes was detached and became the commune of Bois-Colombes (literally "Colombes Woods").

On 2 May 1910, 19% of the (reduced) territory of Colombes was detached and became the commune of La Garenne-Colombes.

Thus, the commune of Colombes is now only two-thirds the size of its territory before 1896.

## Administration
The city is divided into two cantons:

Colombes-1 (north)
Colombes-2 (south)
Transport[edit]
Colombes is served by four stations on the Transilien Paris – Saint-Lazare suburban rail line at Colombes, Le Stade, La Garenne-Colombes and Gare Les Vallées.
